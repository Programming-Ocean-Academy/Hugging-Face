        "\n",
        "| Dimension | GitHub | Hugging Face |\n",
        "|----------|--------|---------------|\n",
        "| Primary Purpose | Global platform for hosting code repositories, version control, collaboration, open-source development. | Specialized ML ecosystem for hosting models, datasets, demos, and providing ML-focused infrastructure. |\n",
        "| Core Philosophy | Democratize software development, empower open-source collaboration. | Democratize good AI, lower barrier for ML research and deployment. |\n",
        "| Target Users | Software developers, open-source teams, DevOps engineers, enterprises, general programmers. | ML researchers, data scientists, AI engineers, educators, LLM builders, startups. |\n",
        "| Repository Structure | General-purpose repos with source code, branches, commits, pull requests. | Three repo types: Models, Datasets, Spaces, each with domain-specific metadata and files. |\n",
        "| Version Control | Git-based; supports Git LFS, branches, tags, forks. | Also Git-based but optimized for large models and datasets using efficient storage. |\n",
        "| Model Hosting | Not optimized for ML model files; large files require LFS; no inference APIs built-in. | Native: automatic model cards, inference widgets, hosted inference API, model versioning. |\n",
        "| Dataset Hosting | Limited; raw data stored via LFS; no dataset loading library. | First-class citizen: datasets library, streaming, splits, loaders, metadata, dataset cards. |\n",
        "| Spaces / App Hosting | GitHub Pages (static only), Actions-based deployments; not ML-specific. | Spaces: free hosting of interactive ML apps (Gradio, Streamlit, React, Docker). |\n",
        "| CI/CD | Advanced workflows, extensive Actions marketplace, multi-language, deploy to any cloud. | Supports workflows via Actions but optimized for training pipelines, model pushes, inference tests. |\n",
        "| APIs | REST and GraphQL APIs for code automation, repo management, actions, issues. | Inference API, text-generation API, embeddings API, hosted models, dataset streaming APIs. |\n",
        "| Search Capabilities | Powerful code search, semantic search, repository-level queries. | Search across models, datasets, Spaces, with filters by task, library, language, license. |\n",
        "| Collaboration Tools | Pull requests, issues, projects, wikis, code review, discussions. | Discussions, model cards, dataset cards, Spaces comments, community demos. |\n",
        "| Documentation Support | Markdown files, Wiki, GitHub Pages. | Model cards, dataset cards, Spaces READMEs, transformer docs, training docs. |\n",
        "| Monetization / Pricing | Free, Pro, Team, Enterprise Cloud, Enterprise Server. | Free, Pro, organizations, private model hosting, paid Inference Endpoints. |\n",
        "| Enterprise Features | SSO, compliance, private clouds, GitHub Copilot Business, security scanning. | Enterprise-grade APIs, private model hosting, managed endpoints, on-prem inference. |\n",
        "| Security Features | Code scanning, secret detection, dependency graphs, CVE alerts. | Model license enforcement, gated datasets, model risks, content filters, Spaces security scopes. |\n",
        "| Identity and Profiles | Developer profile with stats, contributions, stars, followers. | ML-centric profile with models, datasets, Spaces, likes, downloads, tasks. |\n",
        "| Reputation System | Stars, forks, contributions, sponsors. | Likes, downloads, trending, community badges. |\n",
        "| Ecosystem Focus | Software engineering, full-stack development, DevOps, open-source projects. | Machine learning research, model sharing, LLMs, generative AI, datasets, evaluation. |\n",
        "| Integrations | Integrates with IDEs, CI/CD tools, cloud platforms, package managers. | Integrates with Transformers, Diffusers, Datasets, Evaluate, Gradio, Colab, PyTorch, TensorFlow. |\n",
        "| Model Deployment | Requires external infrastructure; Actions can deploy to AWS, Azure, GCP. | One-click Inference Endpoints, Spaces hosting, serverless inference, accelerated hardware. |\n",
        "| Notebook Support | GitHub Codespaces, limited notebook rendering. | Rich notebook support through Hugging Face Hub and Colab direct integration. |\n",
        "| Package Distribution | Supports publishing via GitHub Packages. | Not a package registry, but supports model libraries and dataset pipelines. |\n",
        "| Community Size | ~100M+ developers (largest dev community). | Fastest-growing ML community with millions of users and 100k+ organizations. |\n",
        "| Ideal Use Cases | Software version control, building applications, collaborating on code, managing DevOps pipelines. | Sharing ML models, hosting datasets, deploying ML demos, running inference, building LLM applications. |\n",
        "| Strengths | Mature, secure, universal, deeply integrated with developer workflows. | Purpose-built for AI and ML, best ecosystem for sharing models, datasets, and demos. |\n",
        "| Weaknesses | Not designed for ML model hosting or interactive demos. | Not a full replacement for general-purpose code hosting or CI/CD. |\n",
        "| When to Use Each | Use GitHub to write, manage, and version your software. | Use Hugging Face to host, share, and deploy ML intelligence (models, datasets, apps). |\n",
