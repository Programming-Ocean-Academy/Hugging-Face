        " Popular / Notable Gradio Spaces & Demos\n",
        "\n",
        "| Space / Demo | Why it’s Popular / Noteworthy |\n",
        "|--------------|------------------------------|\n",
        "| **AnimeGAN2 (on HF-Spaces)** | Often cited as among the earliest and most-used “ML demo apps.” In a 2022 industry article, AnimeGANv2 was named “the most popular machine-learning application on Hugging Face Spaces” at that time. |\n",
        "| **Stable-Diffusion demo spaces (e.g., SD / “text-to-image”)** | Because image generation is extremely popular, many Gradio Spaces using stable-diffusion pipelines attract high traffic. The HF docs even reference that Stable Diffusion pipelines are “automatically supported in Gradio” for building live demos. |\n",
        "| **Speech / Whisper + Audio demo Spaces** | With growing interest in speech-to-text / audio apps, Spaces using models like Whisper, or other speech/voice models, tend to be reused and popular. Gradio + HF supports audio demos out-of-the-box. |\n",
        "| **LLM chatbots & text-generation Spaces** | Many small to large-scale language models get wrapped into quick Gradio apps for chat, story-generation, text summarization, etc. Because of the popularity of LLM-based tasks, these remain some of the most used Spaces. HF itself encourages deploying demos via Spaces. |\n",
        "| **Vision-classification / Object-Detection demo Spaces (YOLO / SAM / etc.)** | CV tasks remain popular for live demos: classification, object detection, segmentation using YOLO, SAM, etc. These are often used for quick demos and prototypes via Spaces. |\n",
        "| **Utility / Tool-type Spaces (data-visualization, embeddings explorer, RAG front-ends, simple UIs)** | Not only “big models” but also small tools and utilities built as Gradio Spaces get high adoption because they are lightweight, easy to use, and solve real dev/data tasks. Blog posts highlight using Gradio + Spaces for agent-tools and visualization utilities. |\n",
        "| **Educational / Demo Spaces for beginners** | Spaces used in tutorials, coursework, or teaching (e.g., story generators, voice-to-text demos, beginner ML visualizations) tend to be reused widely as onboarding resources. |\n",

        " Why There’s No Definitive “Top 100” Public Ranking\n",
        "\n",
        "- The Spaces ecosystem is dynamic and constantly changing.  \n",
        "- Usage metrics (traffic, visits, runs) are not publicly aggregated by Hugging Face.  \n",
        "- Popularity is based on community buzz, citations, remix counts, longevity, and relevance.  \n",
        "- “Popular” varies with trends: new models and demos frequently eclipse older ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because of this, discussions about “popular Spaces” generally refer to a combination of:\n",
        "- historical impact,  \n",
        "- community adoption,  \n",
        "- ease of use,  \n",
        "- and relevance for current AI tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        " Recommendation\n",
        "\n",
        "- Choose representative Spaces from each domain (image-generation, LLM chat, audio, vision, utilities).  \n",
        "- Use them as live demos in Programming Ocean Academy courses to show real-world AI deployment.  \n",
        "- Encourage students to fork and remix these Spaces as practical assignments.  \n"
