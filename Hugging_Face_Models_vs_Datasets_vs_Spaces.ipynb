        "|---------------------|--------|----------|--------|\n",
        "| Primary Purpose | Store and distribute machine learning model weights and configs | Host structured data for training, evaluation, benchmarking | Deploy interactive ML apps (demos, UIs, inference apps) |\n",
        "| Typical Users | ML engineers, researchers, developers | Data engineers, ML engineers, researchers | Developers, educators, startups, students |\n",
        "| Core Value | Enables reproducibility and model sharing | Centralized, versioned data accessible through datasets library | Public-facing UI for models for immediate testing and demos |\n",
        "| Repo Structure | config.json, weights (pytorch_model.bin or .safetensors), tokenizer files, model card | Data files (CSV, JSON, Parquet, images, audio), dataset script, dataset card | App code (app.py or server.py), requirements.txt, optional assets |\n",
        "| Mandatory Files | README.md, config.json, model weights | README.md, dataset files or dataset script | README.md, app.py/main.py, requirements.txt |\n",
        "| Optional Files | Tokenizer, generation config, training logs | Statistics JSON, metadata files, processing scripts | Custom CSS, JS, images, Hugging Face Dockerfile |\n",
        "| Versioning | Tagged releases (v1, v2), branches (main, dev) | Same Git-based versioning | Same Git-based versioning (CI/CD supported) |\n",
        "| Storage Type | Binaries + text configs | Structured data (tabular, images, audio, video) | Code + UI assets + optional models |\n",
        "| How to Use | AutoModel + AutoTokenizer | load_dataset() | Visit Space URL or embed it inside apps |\n",
        "| Access Level | Public or private | Public or private | Public or private |\n",
        "| Licensing Options | MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, custom | CC BY-SA, CC BY-NC, custom | MIT, Apache, OpenRAIL, or custom |\n",
        "| Dependencies | Transformers, Diffusers, SentencePiece, PyTorch, TensorFlow | Datasets library, PyArrow | Gradio, Streamlit, Docker, custom environments |\n",
        "| Typical Size | MB → GBs | KB → TBs | Usually small (code-only), unless hosting models inside |\n",
        "| Use in Production | Core inference engines used via API | Training and evaluation source | Light inference UI, not optimized for heavy production |\n",
        "| Hub Integration | Inference API, TGI, Transformers | datasets library, streaming, filtering | Spaces-run inference, external API calls |\n",
        "| Upload Workflow | Web upload or push_to_hub() | Upload files or dataset scripts | Push code through Git |\n",
        "| Download Workflow | from_pretrained() | load_dataset() | Open Space or embed via iframe |\n",
        "| API Access | Fully supported (Inference API) | Fully supported (Datasets API) | Not an API itself, but can call APIs internally |\n",
        "| Compute Requirements | Often heavy (GPU/TPU for training and inference) | Depends on data preprocessing | CPU by default, optional GPU on paid plan or with HF-provided hardware |\n",
        "| Supports Private Repos? | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n",
        "| Most Common Use Cases | NLP, vision, speech, diffusion, embeddings, LLMs | Benchmark datasets, multilingual corpora, curated training data | Demos, prototypes, teaching, model interaction |\n",
        "| Examples | BERT, GPT-J, CLIP, Stable Diffusion | CommonVoice, LAION subsets, custom datasets | Chatbot demo, image generator, RAG search app |\n",
        "| Security Considerations | Weight authenticity, malicious custom code | Data privacy, sensitive content | Arbitrary code execution sandbox, user-uploaded inputs |\n",
        "| Best Practices | Include usage examples, benchmarks, and citations | Add dataset statistics, license, preprocessing steps | Make UI clean, add error handling, display model card |\n",
        "| Typical Development Workflow | Train → Evaluate → push_to_hub() → Share → Deploy | Collect → Clean → Validate → Upload → Document | Write code → Test locally → Push → Auto-deploy |\n",
        "| Integration With Organizations | Team collaboration on shared ML models | Shared corporate or academic datasets | Shared Spaces for demos and internal tools |\n",
        "| Who Benefits Most | Researchers, AI engineers | Data scientists, ML researchers | Educators, startups, marketing teams, demo builders |\n",
        "| Interaction Type | Code-level | Data-level | UI-level |\n",
        "| Offline Usage | Yes (download locally) | Yes (cached via Datasets library) | Limited — primarily online apps |\n",

        "| Strengths | Standardized interfaces (AutoModel) and large ecosystem | Streaming datasets and built-in data pipelines | Fast deployment of ML demos without DevOps |\n",
        "| Limitations | Can be large, slow to load, requires architecture knowledge | Large datasets → slow upload or download | Not optimized for large-scale production workloads |\n",
