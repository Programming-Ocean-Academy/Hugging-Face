This is done by deploying the app to Hugging Face Spaces using a Git-based workflow.\n","\n","1. Create a Hugging Face account if you do not already have one.\n","\n","2. From your Hugging Face profile, start a new Space by clicking **New Space**.  \n","   A Space is essentially a code repository used to host applications and files.\n","\n","3. Assign a name to the Space (for example: `username/foodvision_mini`).  \n","   You may view an example Space at:  \n","   https://huggingface.co/spaces/mrdbourke/foodvision_mini\n","\n","4. Select a license for the project (MIT was used in this case).\n","\n","5. Choose **Gradio** as the Space SDK, since the application is built using Gradio.  \n","   (Other SDKs such as Streamlit are available, but are not used here.)\n","\n","6. Decide whether the Space should be public or private.  \n","   A public Space allows anyone to access and use the demo.\n","\n","7.

Clone the newly created Space repository to your local machine using:\n","   ```bash\n","   git clone https://huggingface.co/spaces/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_SPACE_NAME```\n","\n","Alternatively, files can be uploaded manually via the **Files and versions** tab on Hugging Face.\n","\n","9. Copy or move all contents of the local `foodvision_mini` project directory into the cloned Space repository folder.\n","\n","10. Install **Git LFS (Large File Storage)**, which is required for tracking files larger than 10 MB, such as trained model weights.\n","\n","\n","11. Initialize Git LFS in the repository by running:\n","\n","```bash\n","    git lfs install```\n","\n","12. Configure Git LFS to track large files by specifying their extensions:\n","\n","```git lfs track \"*.file_extension\"```\n","\n","13.
